Bikesharing Analysis Based on Usage in New York City

<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
<h3>What I observed from the data and how it's relevant</h3>

The purpose of this analysis was to determine if bringing a bikesharing program to Des Moines, IA would be beneficial to the community and its residents and visitors. I used data from a New York City bikesharing program from the month of August so it would include a generous amount of data from not only residents but tourists as well. I looked at things like bike checkout times, who is renting bikes, peak usage hours, and frequency of bike repairs to determine if this would be a good fit and a solid business decision as well.

<h1>RESULTS</h1>
<h3>An overview of each Tableau worksheet</h3>

* [Peak Hours in August](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/casey.kimble/viz/PeakHoursinAugust_16642518365410/PeakHoursinAugust?publish=yes) - This visualization shows us peak usage hours for the month of August, with the most in-demand hours being during the morning and evening commute, but still seeing a decent amount of rentals through the entire day, only tapering off from peak usage slightly between 10 AM and 4 PM. There is no doubt that some of the rentals during the morning and evening commute hours are also from tourists so not only are the bikes being used frequently by locals, but by visitors as well.

* [Checkout Times for Users](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/casey.kimble/viz/CheckoutTimesforUsers_16642460106490/CheckoutTimesforUsers?publish=yes) - This visualization shows us that many riders are renting bicycles for several hours, with most bikeshare rentals being kept for about 5 hours. This looks to me like many tourists may be holding on to a single bicycle throughout a chunk of their day to see more of the city, rather than commuters who would likely only rent a bike for the duration of their commute at separate points of the day.

* [Checkout Times by Gender](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/casey.kimble/viz/CheckoutTimesbyGender_16642520564320/CheckoutTimesbyGender?publish=yes) - According to this graph, the vast majority of bicycle renters are male. This is something that would be worth looking into to find out why, although our data doesn't give us much insight into this. It is also perhaps a good reason for a company to promote and cater to more women using a bikeshare program. 

* [Trips by Weekday Per Hour](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/casey.kimble/viz/TripsbyWeekdayPerHour_16642522688000/TripsbyWeekdayperHour?publish=yes) - This heatmap shows us a huge drop-off in usage during commuting hours on the weekend - goes to show the importance of a bikeshare program for the locals and also the importance of making sure that bike repairs must be completed in off-hours making sure the bikes are ready when it they are most needed.

* [Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/casey.kimble/viz/TripsbyGenderWeekdayPerHour_16642524296840/TripsbyGenderWeekdayperHour?publish=yes) - A large part of our commuters are male, which reinforces the data found in the 'Checkout Times for Users' chart as well. 

* [Trips by Gender - Weekday by User](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/casey.kimble/viz/UserTripsbyGenderperWeekday/UserTripsbyGenderperWeekday?publish=yes) - According to this heatmap, the majority of renters are actually subscribers, which tells us that these daily commuters are extremely important to the success of a bikeshare business. Many more users are regular subscribers vs. infrequent riders or visitors to the city.

* [Bike Repairs](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/casey.kimble/viz/BikeRepairs_16642528375100/BikeRepairs?publish=yes) - According to this treemap, the more trips a bike is used for, the more frequently it will need repair. Which may be fairly obvious, but it will be more important to maintain these bikes that are more frequently used as they are likely to be rented from more popular rental stations and used for daily riders who depend on availability.

<h4> Results of the analysis - is Bikesharing a solid investment?</h4>
