Bikesharing Analysis Based on Usage in New York City

OVERVIEW

The purpose of this analysis was to determine if bringing a bikesharing program to Des Moines, IA would be beneficial to the community and its residents and visitors. I used data from a New York City bikesharing program from the month of August to include a generous amount of data from not only residents but tourists as well. I looked at things like bike checkout times, peak usage hours, and frequency of bike repairs to determine if this would be a good fit and also a solid business decision as well.
